# Brest cancer risk prediction using logistic regression model

This is a hands-on project from Coursera focused on building and training a simple logistic regression model  
to predict whether a person has a risk of having brest cancer.  

The main learning points:

* Learn to build the Logistic Regression Model to Classify cancer as Malignant or Benign
* Learn to download dataset directly from Kaggle using Kaggle API

Repo contains two jupiter notebooks (one with and without solutions) and already downloaded dataset from Kaggle.  

To use Kaggle to download dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) registration is needed.
